#NETWORK BASICS 2

##What is the netcat
The nc (or netcat) utility is used for just about anything under the sun involving TCP, UDP, or UNIX-domain
     sockets.  It can open TCP connections, send UDP packets, listen on arbitrary TCP and UDP ports, do port scan‚Äê
     ning, and deal with both IPv4 and IPv6.  Unlike telnet(1), nc scripts nicely, and separates error messages
     onto standard error instead of sending them to standard output, as telnet(1) does with some.

## What is locathost
"Localhost" is a hostname that typically refers to the loopback IP address 127.0.0.1 in IPv4 or ::1 in IPv6. It is commonly used to refer to the local computer or the computer on which the software is running.

When you access "localhost" in a web browser or use it in network configuration settings, you are connecting to the network services running on your own computer. This is often used for testing and development purposes, allowing developers to interact with their own local server without needing to connect to an external network.

## what is 0.0.0.0
The IP address 0.0.0.0 is a special-purpose address used in networking to represent an invalid, unknown, or unspecified target. Its meaning can vary depending on the context in which it's used:

## What is loopback
In networking, "loopback" refers to the process of a message or signal being sent back to the sender without being transmitted to its intended recipient or any other device.
